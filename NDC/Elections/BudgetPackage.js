      House of Merit Setup Package for the Inaugural Congressional Term
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>To the Trustees of the Community Treasury and the Voting Body,</p>
    <p>
      The Governance Working Group, on behalf of the House of Merit, presents
      the "Setup Package" as a formal request for funds for the upcoming
      Congressional term.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h6>Background:</h6>
    <p>
      This package represents the collective effort of consultations and
      planning sessions with key stakeholders. With the dawn of the inaugural
      Congressional term, our primary objective is to ensure a strategic
      allocation of resources, emphasizing areas that align with our community's
      vision and growth. This process has been grounded in data, community
      feedback, and trend analysis to ensure that our priorities are both
      current and forward-looking.
    </p>
    <h6>Budget Overview:</h6>
    <p>
      The budgetary considerations are underpinned by three central pillars:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b> Investment in Talent: Prioritizing </b>the acquisition and
        development of talent, recognizing that human capital is integral to our
        ecosystem's evolution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sustained Support: Allocating </b>resources to ongoing projects,
        especially those that have consistently demonstrated value and
        potential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Innovation & Responsiveness: Allocating</b> funds for new
        initiatives, grounded in emerging trends identified from regular
        community feedback sessions and trend reports.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Transparency Commitment:</h6>
    <p>
      The House of Merit commits to providing quarterly reports on fund
      utilization. These reports will be disseminated through the community's
      online portal and will be accessible to all members, ensuring transparency
      and providing an avenue for feedback.
    </p>
    <h6>Budget Review Process:</h6>
    <p>
      Every 3 months, a comprehensive budget review will be conducted by a panel
      consisting of members from the Eco Strategy & Advisory Panel. This review
      aims to assess the efficacy of the fund utilization and make necessary
      adjustments based on the ecosystem's performance, needs, and feedback.
    </p>

    <h6>Closing Note:</h6>
    <p>
      The allocation of these funds is not merely a procedural task but a
      collective responsibility that will shape our community's trajectory. We
      strongly believe in collaborative decision-making and, hence, request your
      thorough review and ratification. Your feedback and approval will ensure
      we move forward in alignment with our community's aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your diligent attention.</p>
    <p>Warm regards,</p>
    <p>The Governance Working Group, On Behalf of the House of Merit</p>

    <h4>Budget Breakdown</h4>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5>Budget and Cap Definitions</h5>
        <h6>Congressional Term Duration : 6 Months</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The duration for each Congressional term is set at 6 months. This
            standardized period ensures a predictable timeframe for both
            planning and executing various initiatives and projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Total Budget for the Congressional Term: $ 3M USD</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The proposed budget for the entire 6-month period is $3M USD. This
            cap is designed to encourage a focused and strategic allocation of
            resources, ensuring optimal impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Individual Allocation Cap: $100k Maximum per Month</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any single recipient can be allocated a maximum of $100k USD per
            month. This cap ensures that significant projects can receive ample
            funding while maintaining fiscal prudence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Unused Budget Provisions</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any unused budget from a specific month will be rolled over to
            subsequent months, ensuring resources are optimally and flexibly
            utilized.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Additional Treasury Funds</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's crucial to note that any supplementary funds added to the
            community treasury will not automatically adjust the budget cap
            defined in this Setup Package. This policy ensures disciplined
            financial management independent of treasury influxes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Regular Budget Reviews</h5>
        <h6>Quarterly Assessments</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Every three months, a mandatory budget review will be undertaken.
            This review's purpose is to make data-driven adjustments to budget
            allocations, reflecting our community's changing needs and
            priorities. All findings and subsequent actions will be
            transparently communicated to the community.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Definition of Big Budget Items</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Big Budget Item is any single expenditure proposal that exceeds
            $75k. Such expenditures will undergo rigorous review to ensure
            alignment with the community's goals and the highest ROI.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Recurring Budget Items</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Recurring Budget Item refers to any monthly expenditure that
            doesn't exceed the 6-month term duration. For a project to be
            eligible for this, it must have previously secured approval for at
            least one budget request and must have met its Key Performance
            Indicators (KPIs).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Detailed Budget Allocation Template to be filled in by the HoM</h5>
        <p>
          The "Setup Package" requires the House of Merit (HoM) to provide a
          clear and detailed budget allocation, ensuring transparency and
          alignment with our strategic goals. The Council of Advisors (CoA) sets
          the overarching direction, while the HoM refines it into actionable
          financial plans.
        </p>
        <h6>Guidance for HoM's Budget Allocation:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Alignment with CoA: </b> Ensure all allocations align with the
            direction given by the Council of Advisors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Main Categories vs. Subcategories:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Main Categories: Broad areas of focus or investment for the
                term.
              </li>
              <li>Subcategories: Specific areas within each main category.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Criteria for Allocation:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Impact: Prioritize allocations that drive growth and engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevance: Address current needs and anticipate future trends.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accountability: Every allocation should have clear
                justification.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h6>Budget Breakdown Template:</h6>
    <p>
      The HoM should use the template below to detail the budget, providing
      clarity on the planned allocations for the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's vital for the community to have a clear understanding of how funds
      are intended to be used. This structured approach ensures the HoM's budget
      decisions align with the community's values and the strategic direction
      set by the CoA.
